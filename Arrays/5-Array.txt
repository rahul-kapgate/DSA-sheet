1. ArrayList in Java
Definition: A part of Java’s java.util package.
Underlying Data Structure: Resizable array.
Dynamic Resizing: Can grow and shrink in size as needed.
Thread Safety: Not synchronized by default, meaning it’s not thread-safe. Use Collections.synchronizedList() for thread safety.
Access Time: Provides constant-time access to elements (O(1)), but adding or removing elements (especially in the middle) can be slower (O(n)).

ArrayList <String> MyarrayList = new ArrayList<>();
MyarrayList.add("Apple");
MyarrayList.add("Banana");

2. Vector in C++
Definition: Part of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).
Underlying Data Structure: Dynamic array.
Dynamic Resizing: Automatically resizes, usually by doubling the capacity.
Thread Safety: Not thread-safe by default; synchronization is the programmer's responsibility.
Access Time: Provides constant-time access (O(1)), similar to Java’s ArrayList, but with efficient random access.


vector <string> Myvector;
Myvector.push_back("Apple");
Myvector.push_back("Banana");

List in Python
Definition: Built-in data structure in Python.
Underlying Data Structure: Dynamic array.
Dynamic Resizing: Expands automatically, with resizing behavior managed internally.
Thread Safety: Not thread-safe. Requires additional synchronization for concurrent access.
Access Time: Constant-time access (O(1)), but insertion and deletion operations can take linear time (O(n)).

my_list = ["Apple", "Banana"]
my_list.append("Cherry")

Key Points
Resizing: All three structures are dynamic and resize as needed.
Thread Safety: None are thread-safe by default.
Access Time: Access time is O(1) in all three, but modifying the middle of the list can be slower.
